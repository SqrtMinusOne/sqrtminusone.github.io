      <description>I wrote about Emacs and i3 integration around two months ago. Shortly after however, I decided to give EXWM another try, mainly because my largest reservation - lack of performance - seems to have been resolved by updates to the native compilation since my first attempt. Or I may have lost some sensitivity to that issue. Regardless, the second dive into EXWM thus far feels successful, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to share some of my thoughts on the subject.</description>
