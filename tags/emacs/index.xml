      <title>Declarative filesystem management with Emacs &amp; Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2023-11-11-index/</link>

      <description>The post describes a Johnny.Decimal-inspired filesystem structure, declared in an org file and synchronized across machines. Different folders are available on different machines.&#xA;Intro My filesystem is, shall we say, not the most orderly place.&#xA;It&amp;rsquo;s been somewhat messy, and messy in different ways across my three machines. For instance, my laptop had work projects in ~/Code/Job, my work machine had just ~/Code, and so forth.&#xA;Strangely, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find and existing solution to that problem.</description>

      <title>916 days of Emacs</title>

      <description>Poof I made my free-time disappear&#xA;- Ellis Keny≈ë, on being called an &#34;elisp mage&#34; Little did I know on the fateful day of [2020-10-09 Fri], when I had installed GNU Emacs. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t thinking about the ethical aspects of free software, the aesthetics of Lisp, or these other things with which an occasional layperson might explain how an almost half a century old program can still be in active use.</description>

      <title>Running Gource with Emacs</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2023-01-02-gource/</link>

      <description>Gource is a program that draws an animated graph of users changing the repository over time.&#xA;Although it can work without extra effort (just run gource in a git repo), there are some tweaks that can be done:&#xA;Gource supports using custom pictures for users. Gravatar is an obvious place to get these. Occasionally, the same people have different names and/or emails in history.&#xA;It may happen when people use forges like GitLab or just have different settings on different machines.</description>

      <title>Podcast transcripts with elfeed &amp; speech recognition engine</title>

      <description>Edit &amp;lt;2022-10-13 Thu&amp;gt;: Just a couple of days after this post, OpenAI released a speech recognition model called Whisper, which is so much better than anything I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen before. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to leave this post as it is, but check the Emacs config for the updated version.&#xA;In my experience, finding something in a podcast is particularly troublesome. For example, occasionally I want to refer to some line in the podcast to make an org-roam node, e.</description>

      <title>Extending elfeed with PDF viewer and subtitles fetcher</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2022-05-09-pdf/</link>

      <description>Intro elfeed is one of the most popular Emacs packages, and it&amp;rsquo;s also one in which I ended up investing a lot of effort. I wrote about the EMMS integration and even made a custom frontpage to my liking.&#xA;However, sites frequently limit the amount of information shipped in the RSS feed. Oftentimes the entry doesn&amp;rsquo;t include the entire content (of which, by the way, this blog was guilty).&#xA;Also, there&amp;rsquo;s non-textual content, of which in this post I consider YouTube subscriptions.</description>

      <title>A few cases of literate configuration</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2022-02-12-literate/</link>

      <guid>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2022-02-12-literate/</guid>
      <description>A post that arose from the discussion of literate configuration on the System Crafters Discord.&#xA;I am using the literate configuration strategy (based on Emacs&amp;rsquo; Org Mode) to manage most of my configuration files. A piece of such a configuration can be as simple as an Org file, which is tangled to one or many plain-text configuration files, but it can be more.&#xA;In my opinion, a literate configuration can be more straightforward and concise than a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; one, thanks to Org Mode&amp;rsquo;s capabilities of working with source code.</description>

      <title>Using EXWM and perspective.el on multi-monitor setup</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2022-01-03-exwm/</link>

      <guid>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2022-01-03-exwm/</guid>
      <description>I wrote about Emacs and i3 integration around two months ago. Shortly after however, I decided to give EXWM another try, mainly because my largest reservation - lack of performance - seems to have been resolved by updates to the native compilation since my first attempt. Or I may have lost some sensitivity to that issue. Regardless, the second dive into EXWM thus far feels successful, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s the right time to share some of my thoughts on the subject.</description>

      <title>Getting a consistent set of keybindings between i3 and Emacs</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-10-04-emacs-i3/</link>

      <guid>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-10-04-emacs-i3/</guid>
      <description>Intro One advantage of EXWM for an Emacs user is that EXWM gives one set of keybindings to manage both Emacs windows and X windows. In every other WM, like my preferred i3wm, two orthogonal keymaps seem to be necessary. But, as both programs are quite customizable, I want to see whether I can replicate at least some part of the EXWM goodness in i3.&#xA;But why not just use EXWM?</description>

      <title>My EMMS and elfeed setup</title>

      <description>Intro This is the current state of my quest to live in Emacs, at least in part of reading RSS and music.&#xA;Even before I lost my mind about customizing obscure keyboard-driven software, I tried Inoreader, self-hosted FreshRSS, and then newsboat from the RSS side and ncmpcpp+MPD from the audio player side. At some point, I got curious about whether I can do the same in Emacs.&#xA;The respective emacs packages, elfeed and EMMS, proved somewhat tricky to set up, i.</description>

      <title>Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-05-01-org-python/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 01 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-05-01-org-python/</guid>
      <description>Why? Jupyter Notebook and its successor Jupyter Lab providing an interactive development environment for many programming languages are in lots of ways great pieces of software.&#xA;But while I was using the former, and then the latter, I was also an as-full-time-as-one-can-get NeoVim user. &amp;ldquo;As one can get&amp;rdquo; is because, of course, there is no sensible way to extend the NeoVim editing experience to the Jupyter ecosystem.&#xA;A possibility for change appeared with my discovery of Emacs not so long ago.</description>

      <title>Multiple Gmail accounts &amp; labels with Emacs</title>
      <link>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-02-27-gmail/</link>

      <guid>https://sqrtminusone.xyz/posts/2021-02-27-gmail/</guid>
      <description>Intro For quite some time, e-mail seemed like an anomaly in my workflow. I am a long time Gmail user, and my decade-old account has a somewhat formidable quantity of labels and filters. My messages are often assigned multiple labels, and I also like to keep only a bunch of messages in the inbox.&#xA;Although, in my opinion, Gmail web UI was and still is leagues ahead of many of its competitors and even allows keyboard-centric workflow, it&amp;rsquo;s awkward to use with a keyboard-driven browser, and for no money on Earth I would enable browser notifications.</description>
