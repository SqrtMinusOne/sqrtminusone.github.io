      <description>Why? Jupyter Notebook and its successor Jupyter Lab providing an interactive development environment for many programming languages are in lots of ways great pieces of software.
But while I was using the former, and then the latter, I was also an as-full-time-as-one-can-get NeoVim user. &amp;ldquo;As one can get&amp;rdquo; is because, of course, there is no sensible way to extend the NeoVim editing experience to the Jupyter ecosystem.
A possibility for change appeared with my discovery of Emacs not so long ago.</description>
