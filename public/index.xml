      <title>Replacing Jupyter Notebook with Org Mode</title>

      <description>Why? Jupyter Notebook and its successor Jupyter Lab providing an interactive development environment for many programming languages are in lots of ways great pieces of software.
But while I was using the former, and then the latter, I was also an as-full-time-as-one-can-get NeoVim user. &amp;ldquo;As one can get&amp;rdquo; is because, of course, there is no sensible way to extend the NeoVim editing experience to the Jupyter ecosystem.
A possibility for change appeared with my discovery of Emacs not so long ago.</description>

      <title>Multiple Gmail accounts &amp; labels with Emacs</title>

      <description>Intro For quite some time, e-mail seemed like an anomaly in my workflow. I am a long time Gmail user, and my decade-old account has a somewhat formidable quantity of labels and filters. My messages are often assigned multiple labels, and I also like to keep only a bunch of messages in the inbox.
Although, in my opinion, Gmail web UI was and still is leagues ahead of many of its competitors and even allows keyboard-centric workflow, it&amp;rsquo;s awkward to use with a keyboard-driven browser, and for no money on Earth I would enable browser notifications.</description>

      <description>Hello, world! Eventually, there will be something interesting here. Or not.
Regradless, I&amp;rsquo;ll check if I can write some Python here
print(&amp;#34;Hello, world&amp;#34;) Hello, world </description>
